# reCAPTCHA plugin for WordPress
This is a fork of [Shamim Hasan](https://www.shamimsplugins.com)'s [Advanced noCaptcha & invisible Captcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-nocaptcha-recaptcha) version 6.1.5. However, it has been almost completly rewritten with these goals in mind:
* [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) compliant.
* Full support for all versions of [Google's reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/).
* No premium version.

Currently, this plugin is only available here on GitHub. Once installed, however, WordPress will still be able to update it from this repository. This is because in WordPress 5.8 a new plugin header called [Update URI](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/introducing-update-uri-plugin-header-in-wordpress-5-8/) was introduced.

## Requirements
WordPress >= 5.8 (lower may work just fine, but no support for updating from the repository)

PHP >= 7.1

## Features
* Switch between reCAPTCHA versions easily.
	* Each set of keys are tied to the selected version.
	* Custom error message for each version.
* Select the widget's colour theme: *Light*, *Dark* or *Automatic*
	* *Automatic* will set theme based on the background colour's brightness.
* Choose which request domain to use.
	* google.com
	* recaptcha.net
* Verify origin of solutions, if you've opted not to have Google do it.
* Hide for logged in users.
* Set which [language](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/language) to display the widget in.
* Log JSON response data.

* In the database the settings will be stored the `wp_sitemeta` table. This is separate from any sub-sites' settings, which are stored in `wp_<siteID>_options`.
* Settings set by the Super Admin will apply across all sites.
