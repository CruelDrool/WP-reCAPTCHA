# Changelog

## [1.1.5] - 2025-09-19
### Changed
- Fixed comment approval bug introduced in WordPress 6.7 where the function to check comment submissions gets called twice even though the comment is already approved by this plugin. This bug meant that the reCAPTHA token would be also be verified twice and leading to errors about duplicates, which lead to a rejected comment.

## [1.1.4] - 2024-03-30
### Changed
- Updated the "View changelog" page script.
	- Added HTTP header "Accept" to the cURL request to ensure that JSON data is retrieved.
	- Updated the regular expressions that clean up the HTML from GitHub.
	- Updated the CSS colour schemes.

## [1.1.3] - 2023-11-06
### Changed
- Replaced `file_exists()` with `is_file()` for the emergency stop.
- Fixed the fix from [db0296c](https://github.com/CruelDrool/WP-reCAPTCHA/commit/db0296c875310f99f71c1eaa8dba22d55c273d1a)

### Added
- Ability to view the changelog from [GitHub.com](https://github.com). The link is on the plugin's meta row on the "Plugins" page.

## [1.1.2] - 2023-10-28
### Changed
- Discovered an issue where the sanitization of the settings was happening when calling `update_option()` (`update_site_option()` when network activated on multisite) and not before. This lead to default values some times being stored in the database. The idea is to keep the stored settings free of default values.
	- Fixed it so that sanitization is done first before saving.
- Did some clean up of the settings page.
	- Setting "Load on ..." changed to "Load on all pages".
	- Section "Other" has been removed. The settings have been moved up to "General".
	- Threshold values changed from input type `select` (dropdown) to `number`.
	- Option "Secret Key" changed to input type `password`, with a toggle button to view the value.
	- Log rotations changed from input type `select` (dropdown) to `radio` to better display the different date formats.
	- Added link to an article about domain validation.
	- Made textboxes using CSS class `.regular-text` a bit wider; from 25em to 28em.
	- Added icon and screen reader text to links that open in a new tab.
- Fix a small update mess up from 1.1.1.
- Various code clean ups.
- Translations updated.

	- "Path to log directory": Specify your own directory where the log files will be stored.
- Added an emergency stop.
	- Creating a file named "disable" in the plugin's directory will stop the execution of its code.

	- Output a information message if the sanitized action name differs from the input name.
